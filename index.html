        <h2 id="Where-do-they-live">Where Do Amur Leopards Live?</h2>
        
        <p>The Amur leopard, also known by its scientific name Panthera Pardus Orientalis, lives in the Russian Far East and along the 
        Russian border with North East China. Most of the Amur leopards live in forests of eastern Russia which have cold winters and 
        warm summers. The Amur leopard is the most northern of all leopard subspecies. In the morning they usually sleep in caves or 
        sheltered places.</p>

        <h2 id="Characteristics-and-features">Characteristics and Features</h2>
        
        <p>The Amur leopard has soft fur which is covered in rosettes (black spots). Amur leopards, similarly to other leopards, can run 
        about 59.5 kilometers per hour. They can also jump about 5.8 meters horizontally, and up to about 3 meters vertically. The Amur 
        leopard usually lives 10 - 15 years in the wild, however in captivity they can live up to 20 years. Male Amur leopards 
        typically range from 107 centimeters to 136 centimeters in length additionally with a 82 centimeter to 90 centimeter tail. Male 
        Amur leopards usually weigh 32.2 kilograms to 48 kilograms. Female Amur leopards typically weigh 25 kilograms to 42.5 
        kilograms. The Amur leopard, like many predators, is a skilled hunter. Additionally the Amur leopard is a good swimmer and a 
        good climber. Their tail helps them balance when catching prey, running or climbing trees. Amur leopards are extraordinarily 
        strong, this is because they can carry up to three times their body weight.</p>

        <!-- This paragraph has the special character "&8217;" and it is important because it makes a normal apostrophe into a curved one. -->
        
        <p>The Amur Leopard has many adaptations which help them to survive in the wild. These land mammals have both behavioural and 
        physical adaptations. One of the biggest physical adaptations is their fur. Their fur helps them camouflage with snow and trees 
        allowing them to hunt prey, additionally their fur changes in thickness depending on the weather. When it is winter and the 
        weather is cold and harsh, the Amur leopard&#8217;s fur is thick. This helps them stay warm in the harsh weather. When it is summer and 
        the weather begins to get hot, that&#8217;s when the Amur leopard’s fur decreases. This helps them to stay cool and not to overheat. 
        Another physical adaptation would be the Amur leopard’s long legs. This adaptation is crucial as it helps them to easily run 
        through the snow when it is winter. This makes it easier to catch prey. The last physical adaptation the Amur leopard has is 
        night vision. Since Amur leopards are nocturnal their night vision helps them hunt their prey more easily. Moving on to 
        behavioural adaptations, one of the behavioural adaptations the Amur leopard developed was how they hunt. They hunt by walking 
        quietly in the shadows and creeping up on their prey. Another behavioural adaptation the Amur leopard uses is fake limping. Amur 
        leopards use this strategy so the prey thinks that the Amur leopard can’t run. Once the prey comes close enough that’s when the 
        Amur leopard stops acting, and starts running. The last behavioural adaptation the Amur leopard uses is hiding prey in trees. 
        They carry their prey and hide it on trees, this way no other predators can reach it.</p>
        
        <h2 id="Reproduction">Reproduction</h2>
        
        <p>The Amur leopard is usually solitary and very territorial, Amur leopards only come together to mate. Amur leopards start 
        mating when they are three to four years old in age. 12 weeks after mating one to four cubs are born. Amur leopards usually breed 
        in the months of January and February. Amur leopard cubs are born blind, only after seven to eight days do they start to open 
        their eyes. Additionally Amur leopard cubs weigh 500 grams to 700 grams at birth. By the second month Amur leopard cubs can eat 
        meat. When Amur leopard cubs reach the age of three months they learn how to hunt. Amur leopard cubs stay with their mother until 
        the age of two and become independent at the age of two to three years old.</p>

        <h2 id="Amur-leopard-affect">How Does the Amur Leopard Affect the Ecosystem?</h2>
        
        <p id="Different-paragraph-dimensions">The Amur leopard is crucial for their ecosystem because without them there would be decreased 
        or no biodiversity at all. The Amur leopard’s ecosystem, like any ecosystem, has consumers, producers, and decomposers. There are many 
        consumers which are prey for the Amur leopard. Some prey the Amur leopard eats are the Roe deer, wild boar, Sika deer, and hare. Without 
        the Amur leopard there would be less carnivores to limit the reproduction of prey. If there are more prey and they continue to eat grass, for 
        example, the grass will lessen drastically. This will eventually lead the herbivores to move away because they won’t have any 
        food left. If this happens then decomposers won’t be able to decompose anything for new plant growth. Therefore without the Amur
        leopard the food chain would break down and ecosystems would be affected.</p>

        <!-- This paragraph has the special characters "&#8220;" and "&#8221;" and they are important because they make normal quotes into curved quotes. -->
        
        <p>The sad reality is that Amur leopard’s are critically endangered, they are on the brink of extinction. Currently in 2021 there 
        are only about 100 Amur leopards left in the entire world. The reason the Amur leopard is endangered is because of many factors,
        but most of them are because of humans. The first factor which contributed to the near extinction of the Amur leopard was       
        poaching. As Anthony Douglas Williams said, &#8220;there are more dangerous humans on earth than dangerous animals.&#8221; We can 
        clearly see this in the case of the Amur leopards. Poachers have been overhunting the Amur leopard for its beautiful fur. 
        Poachers do this to sell the fur for lots of money, usually on the black market. The second reason the Amur leopard is critically 
        endangered is because of habitat loss. Humans have been chopping down trees in the forests of where the Amur leopard lives. 
        People were doing this in order to clear space for farming and for resources, however it has not benefited the ecosystem. The 
        Amur leopard’s prey have moved away due to habitat loss and now the Amur leopard’s have almost no food left. Additionally there 
        have been many forest fires which have been burning down the forests of where the Amur leopard lives. Lastly the Amur leopard is 
        critically endangered because of inbreeding. The remaining Amur leopards could go extinct because of genetic degeneration. This 
        genetic degeneration is supposedly caused because of inbreeding between Amur leopards for several generations. Genetic 
        degeneration affects the survival, health and reproduction of Amur leopards.</p>

        <!-- This paragraph has external links but it also has the attribute target="_blank" what this attribute does is open the link in another tab. -->
        
        <p>There are many things which are being done to prevent the Amur leopard’s extinction. Organizations like the 
             <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org" target="_blank">WWF</a> 
        support anti poaching in all regions of where the Amur leopard lives. The WWF supports and puts programs into place which stop 
        trade of Amur leopard parts. The WWF works with 
            <a href="https://www.traffic.org/" target="_blank">TRAFFIC,</a>
        a wildlife monitoring network, together they help governments to make trade restrictions on Amur leopard parts. Groups and 
        charities focused on the conservation of the Amur leopard also try educating local residents on why the Amur leopard is
        important. By doing so local residents will support anti poaching efforts and realize that the Amur leopard is an important 
        animal to the ecosystem. The WWF helps to increase the prey of the Amur leopard. Things like the roe deer, sika deer, and wild 
        boar are some prey which are being released to increase the Amur leopard’s population. The WWF protects the habitats of the Amur 
        leopard. They try to reduce people chopping down trees in the areas of where the Amur leopard lives. Additionally the WWF
        influenced the Russian government to make a new protected area for the Amur leopard. In 2012 &#8220;Land of the Leopard National 
        Park&#8221; extended about 263 000 hectares of protected land. This is about 60% of the Amur leopard’s remaining habitat. In conclusion 
        Conversation efforts have been going incredibly well, in the year 2000 there were about 30 Amur leopards and in 2021 there are about 100 
        Amur leopards.</p>
